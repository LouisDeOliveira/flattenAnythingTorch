# flattenAnythingTorch

Simple torch implementation of the paper : ["Flatten Anything: Unsupervised Neural Surface Parameterization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14633) by Zhang et al. using torch 2.5.1+cu124 and python 3.12 that doesn't require to build any external cpp or cuda modules. This gain in simplicity of the code is contrasted by worse peformance than the original implementation.
